/**
 * Wrapper for a list of [EQPreset]s that includes a timestamp to ensure distinct identity.
 *
 * This class is used to force emission of updates in a [StateFlow] even when the list content
 * hasn't changed. By updating the [lastUpdate] field (defaulting to the current time), a new
 * instance is created, ensuring that collectors are notified of a new value.
 *
 * @property list The actual list of equalizer presets.
 * @property lastUpdate A timestamp indicating when this wrapper was created or last updated.
